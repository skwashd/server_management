Server Management Commands for Drush

This plugin is designed to be a cross platform tool for managing basic
server tasks through drush.

The plugin currently supports:

 * Distro type detection
 * Apache config file path resolution
 * Restarting apache gracefully

Requirements
This plugin only works on Linux.  I have no interest in making it work under
Windows.

You must have the lsb_release command available on the server.  All commands 
rely on it.

Install
To install the plugin for a single user run the command below in ~/.drush.
Alternatively if you want to make it available for all users then run it from
/usr/share/drush/commands.

git clone git@github.com:skwashd/server_management.git

You may have to run "drush cc drush" for it to pickup the new plugin.

Caveats
The plugin assumes that standard distro packages are being used, or at least
the normal paths and commands for the distro are being used. Stock source
compiled binaries may not be compatible with this plugin.

I have only tested this with drush 5. It might work with drush 4, but I won't
guarantee that it will continue to work.

TODO
 * Add varnish restart
 * Add memcache restart
 * Enable/disable virtual hosts
