Server Management Commands for Drush

This plugin is designed to be a cross platform tool for managing basic
server tasks through drush.

The plugin currently supports:

 * Distro type detection
 * Apache config file path resolution
 * Restarting apache gracefully

Requirements
This plugin only works on Linux.  I have no interest in making it work under
Windows.

You must have the lsb_release command available on the server.  All commands 
rely on it.

Caveats
The plugin assumes that standard distro packages are being used, or at least
the normal paths and commands for the distro are being used. Stock source
compiled binaries may not be compatible with this plugin.

TODO
 * Add varnish restart
 * Add memcache restart
 * Enable/disable virtual hosts
